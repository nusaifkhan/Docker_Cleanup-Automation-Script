    docker_cleanup()
# This script performs a comprehensive cleanup of Docker containers, images, volumes, and networks.
# It stops all running containers, removes all containers and images,
# and cleans up unused volumes and networks.
# It uses subprocess to run Docker commands in the shell.
# The script is designed to be run as a standalone program.
# It handles errors gracefully and prints a success message upon completion.
# The script is intended for users who want to free up space and resources
# by cleaning up their Docker environment.
# Note: Use this script with caution, as it will remove all Docker containers, images, and volumes.
# Make sure to back up any important data before running it.
# This script is intended for users who are familiar with Docker and its command-line interface.
# It is recommended to run this script in a controlled environment
# where you can safely perform cleanup operations.
# The script is written in Python and uses the subprocess module
